This only contains one file, Driver.java. It runs in the terminal with just native Java stuff. Follow the instructions and calculate the Legendre symbol of a number mod some prime!

The Legendre symbol is a simple notation for describing whether a number is a quadratic residue in the integers mod some prime. It is a specific case of the Jacobi symbol.

This showcases some of my favorite elementary number theory: it takes advantage of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, Gauss's Lemma, the fact that the Legendre symbol is completely multiplicative, and the fact that Legendre(A/B) = Legendre((A mod B)/B).
